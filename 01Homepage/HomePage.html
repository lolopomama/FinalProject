    	 <h2>Welcome to Game Zones Store !!</h2>
         
         <p>
                GAME is not just a place for games - it's a place for gaming.
				</p>
				<p>
                We love games. We love playing them. We love talking about them. And we know you all love playing and talking about them, too. So we have 				made the perfect place to do it - the GAME Community.
				</p>
                <p>
				There are plenty of ways to get involved with the GAME community. For starters, there's social media. We love Facebook and Twitter, and we love that we can share exclusive behind-the-scenes info for you that you can't get anywhere else. We run regular gaming contests and competitions with cool prizes, and we even give you the chance to ask questions to key game developers and share your gaming talents with over 350,000 other gaming fans.
				</p>
                <p>
				On top of this we've got our very own online community area, where you can post reviews of your recent orders, write your own blog and more - all shared with fellow GAME customers.
				</p>
                <p>
So whether you're a hardcore gamer or a party gamer, male, female, young or just young at heart, you have a place in the GAME Community. Hook up and get involved!
